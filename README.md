## D-Screen AI: What is it?

A Generative AI Chatbot that assess, gives advice, and provides help to young adults and adolescents with social media addiction. 

## Why D-Screen AI? 

Social media addiction is a growing concern, particularly among adolescents, leading to various mental health issues, decreased academic performance, and physical health problems. The D-Screen AI app aims to provide continuous support and guidance to users struggling with social media addiction by offering personalized, AI-generated advice and strategies.

Existing solutions for managing social media usage are often limited in scope, typically addressing either general usage statistics or basic reminders. D-Screen AI takes a comprehensive approach by:

- Providing 24/7 support through AI-driven interactions.
- Offering personalized strategies based on individual usage patterns and addiction severity.
- Using AI to generate engaging and effective reminders and goals.
- Promoting healthier online habits through continuous assessment and feedback.
- Most importantly, D-Screen AI aims to offer practical and personalized support, helping users to reduce their social media 
  usage and improve their overall well-being.

## Our Solution

We developed D-Screen AI, a prototype designed to tackle social media addiction by leveraging AI technologies. The application provides users with personalized reminders and goal-setting conversations to help them reduce their social media usage and cultivate healthier online habits. Key features include:

Personalized Reminders: Encouraging reminders based on the user's level of social media addiction, helping them to stay mindful of their usage.
SMART Goals: Personalized goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound to help users gradually reduce their social media time.
Addiction Assessment: A tool to assess the severity of social media addiction through AI-generated prompts and a user-friendly interface.
The application uses OpenAI's GPT for text generation and Streamlit for creating an interactive web interface.
